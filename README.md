# A Room - A Psychological Exploration

By LTBlueLatios

## Purpose

This project was created as a result of my new career change: Psychology. My past goals of being a cetologist very well stays, however I have found the works of marine biology unappealing and "boring". To me, studying a dolphin's behavior / conscience is more interesting then studying the actual chemistry / anatomy of them. This project, I hope, furthers my studies in psychology and learn about the different behaviors and effects of a human's mind. I will then hopefully transfer this knowledge to help me aid me in the study that I yearn for the must:

Dolphin psychology

> If I could just see through a dolphin's perspective for one day, then my life is complete.

In the end, this project serves as a fullfillment of all of my greatest skills combined into one creation.

## Introduction

The Room Model is a metaphorical framework developed by LTBlueLatios that uses the setting of a room to encapsulate the internal experience of an individual with a particular psychological state or condition, such as depression, grief, schizophrenia, or ADHD. It employs symbolic elements within the room and associated actions taken by the individual to represent the symptoms, challenges, emotional responses, and potential strategies for managing or coping with the condition.

The game itself is coded in pure JS, HTML, and CSS. You can run this on your browser that supports the latest JS features. I do not provide support for non-Chromium browsers (ex: Firefox, Brave, Safari) or browsers that inject "anti-ad" / filtering JS code (ex: OperaGX, Vivaldi with filtering on).

Here’s an overview of how the model works and guidance on how it can be adapted to other conditions:

## Basic Structure of the Room Model

Room Setting:

- The room represents the individual’s mind or personal psychological space.
- Certain features (walls, window, furniture, etc.) symbolize key aspects of the condition’s impact on the individual’s life and perception.

Environmental Elements:

- Colors (or lack thereof), light sources, shadows, and temperature capture the mood and the emotional climate associated with the condition.
- Distortions or alterations in the room reflect cognitive disruptions or changes in perception.

Objects and Items:

- Specific objects within the room (clocks, mirrors, vials, etc.) represent symptoms, coping mechanisms, and the passage of time or the influence of external factors.
- The condition of these items and the individual’s interactions with them capture behaviors, decision-making processes, and the consequences of these choices.

Actions and Pathways:

- **Choices** available to the individual within the room signify different behavior strategies or treatment options. These can range from adaptive to maladaptive approaches.
- **Reactions** (anger, hope, fear) to these choices indicate emotional responses and resistance or adaptation to change.
- **Scenarios** are used to help immerse the user into the experience. It describes events that don't require a user's interaction to manifest.
